		<label>tech priest robe</label> <!-- TODO: Edit Name -->
		<description>A sturdy long robe, usually worn by the priesthood of Adeptus Mechanicus. The individual design may vary, depending on the forge world and the position of the priest in Mechanicus hierarchy, as well as their body structure. Those robes are adorned with Mechanicus iconography and gear-like ornaments signifying the wearer's position in Mechanicus hierarchy.n\n\ Such robes became a traditon since the earliest days of the Age of Strife, when Mars was isolated from Terra and Mars' atmospheric shields gave away, leaving the planet exposed to deadly radiation, so such hoods and thick sturdy robes became a necessity.</description> <!-- TODO: Edit Desc -->

		<description>The most common kind of headwear for a member of the Adeptus Mechanicus - a hood made out of sturdy material. Usually it has the same colour and ornament as the robe, however it's not necessary.

Simply approaching them is akin to inviting a death from radiation poisoning. This, however is not exception for Skitarii Vanguard themselves, as they comparably quickly become martyrs to their own extremely deadly weapons.</description> <!-- TODO: Edit Desc -->

		<description>Skitarii ranger helmet consists of two parts: a helmet itself and a hood of the ranger's robe. The faceplate of the helmet serves a double purpose. Apart from protecting the wearer's vital organs, it also serves as a transmitting device for all the sensory information that a skitarii ranger receives on their mission. Ranger's eyes are constantly open, as their eyelids are surgically removed, so that the magos in control would not miss a single detail. Skitarii helmet also has a built-in rebreather, a necessity in toxic atmosphere of Mars, as well as many battlefields across the Galaxy.</description> <!-- TODO: Edit Desc -->

		<description>Skitarii vanguard helmets are designed to provide a substantial degree of defence against most of kinds of damage, as well as shield it's user against the deadly radiation coming from weapons most commonly used by the Skitarii vanguard.

And on the rare occasions these warriors unscrew their helmets, the sight of their missing teeth and hairless, sore-pocked skin tells the awful truth.
